**Description:**

In this world of busyness, shortcuts are the way to go.  Our App is one of those shortcuts!  It will help plan your day off, weekend, or vacation.  

This application will allow you enter your interests and a city and it will return all the ticketed events from your search.  It will save your previous search history and allow you to re-search them at will. 

**Requirements met:**

1. Use of at least, two server-side API's (Ticketmaster, MapQuest) 
2. Use of a CSS framework other than BootStrap (Materialize)
3. Must be interactive
4. Use of at least one new 3rd Party API (Lodash)
5. Good Quality Coding Standards
6. Polished UI

**Technologies Used:**

    * HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Materialize
    * Ticketmaster API, MapQuest API, LoDash API


**Potential Areas for Development:**

As we are in the infancy of its development, the opportunities for growth are plentiful.  

1. We can build the platform utilizing other API's
2. We can offer the option of linking to purchasing agents
3. We can potentially offer demographics to promoters for future events.
